            Fishing is a hobby well known around the world, it's one of the oldest dating back over 40,000 years.
            It first started as a way to get food and overtime became more than just that. Today it has turned 
            into a diverse global practice, people fish in oceans, rivers, and lakes for recreational and commercial.
            Theres various spieces you can fish for some even require special techniques to help you secure the catch.
            These techniques vary from fly fishing for trout in rivers which has a elegant style to deep sea fishing 
            for tuna which require massive reels and utilizing radars. Fishing overall has changed from what once used
            as a survival skill to an activity practiced for tradition and a worldwide food source. I chose fishing as
            my topic because of how it has changed my life in a major way. Before fishing I used always feel overwhelmed
            by the stressers of life. Once I started fishing, the serenity I feel from being out in the wilderness with 
            no sound besides nature has helped me feel relief. Fishing not only is a destresser for me but I get to spend
            some quality time with my family. I would consider myself a <a href="https://www.wildtrout.org/trout-facts">trout</a> fisherman, although I have
            fished for bass a few times.
